# Multimodal Material Feature Identification

This project is a part of a research paper titled - "Multimodal feaure-based surface material classification" (refer to link below). 
This is an implementation of Force Sensing Resistors, Accelerometer and the Fourier analysis of the data collected.

## Contains
* Arduino impplementation of accelerometer
* Arduino implementation of FSR
* Fourier analysis of the recorded signals stored in a .csv file
